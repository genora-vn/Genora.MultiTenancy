If 'SaveChanges' fails, then the transaction cannot be automatically rolled back to a known clean state. Instead, the transaction should be rolled back by the application before retrying 'SaveChanges'. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2149338 for more information and examples.

If 'SaveChanges' fails, then the transaction cannot be automatically rolled back to a known clean state. Instead, the transaction should be rolled back by the application before retrying 'SaveChanges'. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2149338 for more information and examples.
